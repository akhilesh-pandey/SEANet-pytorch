# SEANet-pytorch

## This repository contains the Pytorch implementation of SEANet for datasets CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.

## The base for SEANet is SENet (for SENet the base is ResNet-20). 
### The SEANet architecture uses an extra aggregate block in addition to the Squeeze-Excitation (SE) block.

### All the files including the instructions to use (readme.txt) is available in the folder SEANet-cifar10 and SEANet-cifar100 for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets respectively.

## Highest validation accuracy:
### CIFAR-10 : 95.7
### CIFAR-100 : 78.67
